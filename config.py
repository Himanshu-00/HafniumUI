PROMPT1 = """

A photorealistic portrait of a 23-year-old male model from Brazil, dressed in a tailored charcoal suit and matching tie that conveys sophistication.
He is positioned against a minimalist black background in a well-lit studio, with dramatic lighting that highlights the contours of his suit and creates a striking visual contrast. 
The image is captured in a three-quarter angle, 8K HDR, emphasizing the suit's craftsmanship.

"""

PROMPT2 = """

A photorealistic portrait of a 23-year-old male model from Germany, presenting a polished look in a tailored light gray suit and matching tie.
He stands against a soft white backdrop in a professional studio setting, enhanced by bright, focused lighting that accentuates the suit's details and creates a clean, modern aesthetic.
The image is captured in a close-up shot, 8K HDR, reflecting the suit's elegance.

"""

PROMPT3 = """

A photorealistic portrait of a 23-year-old male model from Japan, showcasing a tailored black suit and matching tie that radiates confidence. 
He is set against a deep blue background in a contemporary photo studio, with strategic lighting that highlights the suit's sharp lines and luxurious fabric. 
The image is captured in a full-body shot, 8K HDR, illustrating the suit's sophisticated design.

Anatomical Prohibition Suite:
"UNREALISTIC HUMAN FORM REJECTION: Severely deformed hands, mutated digits, fused limbs, scoliosis/kyphosis spinal deviations, asymmetrical hemibody proportions, biomechanical joint violations (hyperextended elbows/knees), phantom limbs, limb duplication artifacts, uncanny valley morphogenesis, congenital anomaly patterns (amelia/phocomelia), post-traumatic disfigurement simulations, cervical-thoracic misalignment, pelvic tilt distortions, limb-length discrepancies >2% biomechanical tolerance, non-Euclidean skeletal topology, fractal-based anatomical recursion"

Photorealistic Enforcement Protocol:

Strict 8K UHD fidelity mandate: Reject Rayleigh scattering artifacts, chromatic aberration, moirÃ© patterns, JPEG quantization noise

Absolute prohibition: Neural rendering artifacts, GAN finger mutations, diffusion model watermarks, latent space interpolation glitches

Skin topology requirements: Subsurface scattering compliance, pore-level microtexture accuracy, hemoglobin-chromophore distribution authenticity

Biomechanical Constraints:
"BANISHED: Improper scapulohumeral rhythm, non-orthopedic gait kinematics, patellar maltracking simulations, unphysiological lumbar lordosis, sternoclavicular dislocation patterns, temporomandibular joint dysmorphia, carpal tunnel compression geometries, iliotibial band tension anomalies, achilles tendon insertion point deviations >1.5mm"

Professional Presentation Parameters:

Full-spectrum anti-deformation matrix: Prevent trapezius overbulking, deltoid flattening, intercostal space distortion

Necktie physics enforcement: Windsor knot structural integrity, silk-drape fluid dynamics, anti-gravity defiance validation

Fabric simulation safeguards: Prevent cloth clipping, unrealistic wrinkle propagation, non-PBR material responses

Optical Perfection Standards:

Prime lens emulation: Prohibit focal length <85mm, barrel/pincushion distortion >0.5%, spherical aberration

Photon-level lighting control: Reject caustic patterns, non-uniform lux distribution, CRI <98 light sources

Retinal biology compliance: Perfect vergence-accommodation conflict resolution, natural scleral vascular patterning

Enhanced Negative Prompt Syntax:
"(Deformed iris morphology:1.5), (aberrant dermatoglyphics:1.3), (improper nail bed integration:1.4), (non-Fibonacci spiral ear geometry:1.6), (non-Newtonian synovial fluid representation:1.2), (discontinuous suprasternal notch alignment:1.7), (improper philtrum-columnellar relationship:1.5), (incorrect helical rim light reflection:1.3), (violated golden ratio facial thirds:1.8), (non-anatomical clavicular curvature:1.6)"

Anti-Deformity Reinforcement:
"EMERGENCY PROTOCOL: Full-body CT scan verification overlay - Immediate rejection of outputs failing DEXA-simulated bone density maps, MRI-validated soft tissue alignment, or violating Visible Human Project cross-sectional atlases"


"No distracting visual elements or cluttered backgrounds with complex patterns, busy textures, or elements that draw attention away from the subject."
"No low-resolution, pixelated, blurry, or out-of-focus images; the image must maintain sharp, high-definition details."
"No stylized, cartoon-like, illustrated, painterly, or non-photorealistic rendering styles; the output must appear entirely realistic."
"No exaggerated facial expressions, dramatic makeup, extreme contouring, or overly styled, unnatural-looking hair."
"No informal, wrinkled, ill-fitting, or inappropriate clothing; avoid casual wear, visible logos, flashy designs, or distracting accessories."
"No harsh, uneven, or extreme lighting conditions; avoid overexposure, harsh shadows, lens flares, or dramatic contrasts."
"No environmental context or busy backgrounds; the image must have a simple, controlled studio-like setting."
"No perspective distortions, unflattering camera angles, or unnatural proportions; ensure a direct, centered, and balanced view."
"No heavy post-processing, unnatural color grading, or excessive digital manipulation; maintain a natural and realistic aesthetic."
"No dynamic or candid poses; the subject must maintain a neutral, professional, and controlled posture."
"No facial orientation other than a direct, centered front-facing view with a neutral and professional expression."
"No visible body tilt or unnatural inclinations; ensure upright body alignment without extreme angles (e.g., no 100-degree or diagonal tilt)."
"No unnatural hand positioning or gestures; hands, if visible, must rest naturally without appearing forced or awkward."
"No bold, patterned, reflective, or unconventional neckwear; decorative or alternative styles are to be avoided."
"Maintain precise, anatomically correct body proportions, with natural shoulder width and limb length."
"No visual stretching or compression of body parts; preserve a natural human silhouette."
"Ensure a conservative, solid-color necktie in navy blue or charcoal gray, neatly knotted at the collar, with a matte, non-reflective finish."
"The tie width must be proportional to the suit lapels, positioned centrally for a polished appearance."
"Avoid body positions or angles that distort the natural upright posture; the subject must face the camera with no extreme tilts or unusual rotations."
"No disproportionate body shapes, no stretched or compressed limbs, no irregular shoulder widths, no unnatural silhouettes, no distorted anatomy, no warped proportions."
